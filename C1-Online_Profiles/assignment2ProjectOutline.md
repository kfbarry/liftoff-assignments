Media Review App
The MVP for our media review app will allow users to add a book and give it a numerical rating. Other users will be able to search through the database to find specific books. They will be able to rate the books. The app will show an average combined user rating for each book. The database will store specific books and user ratings. The views will show a home screen, a search option, a display list, and individual book display.
